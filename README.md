To start:
* Put all the files on your server
* Import into your database database.sql as SQL file
* Configure init.file ... Update your db settings
* Enjoy! 


Notes: 
* For database connection using pdo
* Indexes in DB are used for faster queries
* Code follows PSR-2
* No frameworks used (only JQUERY library)
* Might have a few security holes
* PHPUNIT has only 1 test currently... It can be run with
    ./vendor/bin/phpunit function when it is main directory (php2)
* In welcome screen it is designed so that person can see only
those tests who have at least one question with at least on answer
* Dependecy injection used
* For further questions contact me on ciekurs.martins@gmail.com :)
