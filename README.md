To start:
* Upload all the files on your server
* Import into your database db.sql as SQL file
* Configure init.file ... Update your db settings
* Enjoy! 


Notes: 
* For database connection using pdo
* Indexes in DB are used for faster queries
* Code follows PSR-2
* No frameworks used (only JQUERY library)
* Might have a few security holes
* PHPUNIT has 1 test... It can be run with ./vendor/bin/phpunit function 
* In welcome screen it is designed so that person can see only
those tests who have at least one question with at least one answer
* Dependecy injection is used
